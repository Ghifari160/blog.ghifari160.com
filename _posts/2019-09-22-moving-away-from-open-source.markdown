**Update #1** Oct 1, 2019

I have begun the drafting process of the license. As of now, the license is still untitled. If you would like to help me select an appropriate name for the license, feel free to take this [Test Group Questionnaire](https://g16.click/2o3z9c2)

Last night, during my nightly "I need to read something to fall asleep" routine, I learned that a large open source project made the move to block I.C.E. contributors from ever using their project. It inspired me to do the same. I don't care what your political alignment is, the way I.C.E. treat their detainees is not how you should treat even the worst of criminals, let alone mere immigrants seeking asylum.

This morning, I made the decision to prevent any government agency from using my code without first contacting me. I have begun the work on writing a general license for all of my projects. Following this decision, I will no longer be using any license approved by the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org) (OSI) for my projects. While that does mean that I am moving away from publishing my projects as open source, it does not mean that I will be closing down my projects from the rest of the general public. In fact, it does not even mean that I deny access to my projects to all government agencies. It simply means that government agencies will need to contact me first. Whether I will comply with their request will be determined on a case-to-case basis.

**As of today, the majority of my projects are still published under the MIT License, though this will soon change.**
